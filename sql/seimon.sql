After comparing data, the window shows the number of records that will be inserted, updated or deleted in the target. It can also manage cloud databases such as Amazon Redshift, Amazon RDS, Alibaba Cloud. Features in Navicat are sophisticated enough to provide professional developers for all their specific needs, yet easy to learn for users who are new to database server. Navicat Monitor requires a repository to store alerts and metrics for historical analysis. The Navigation pane employs tree structure which allows you to take action upon the database and their objects through their pop-up menus quickly and easily.', '2013-06-09 19:38:45');
